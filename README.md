I am Baozhe, currently an undergraduate student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. My major is computer engineering. I am interested in developing highly efficient real-time robot algorithms (using C++) that can run with limited resources (e.g., edge computers on robots). Multi-robot systems, motion planning, SLAM, optimal control, and machine learning with robots are my interested fields.

ðŸ¤” Recent news: 
- ðŸ”­ I'm working on an MPC controller for drones in non-inertial frames. Please check [CoNi-MPC](https://fast-fire.github.io/CoNi-MPC/) for more information.
- ðŸŒ± I finished my RA internship at Fast Lab, ZJU (2022/06 - 2023/08).
