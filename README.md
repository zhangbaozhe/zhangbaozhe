I am Baozhe, currently an undergraduate student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. My major is computer engineering. I am interested in developing highly efficient real-time robot algorithms (using C++) that can run with limited resources (e.g., edge computers on robots). I am interested in multi-robot systems, motion planning, SLAM, optimal control, and machine learning with robots.
