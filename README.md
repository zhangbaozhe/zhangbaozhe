I am now an incoming PhD student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). I am interested in developing highly efficient real-time robot algorithms (using C++) that can run with limited resources (e.g., edge computers on robots). I am interested in motion planning, trajectory optimization, reinforcement learning, and multi-robot systems.
