I am Baozhe, currently an undergraduate student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. My major is computer engineering. I am interested in developing highly efficient real-time robot algorithms (using C++) that can run with limited resources (e.g., edge computers on robots). Multi-robot systems, motion planning, SLAM, advanced control, and machine learning with robots are my interested fields. Recently, 
- ðŸ”­ I'm working on an MPC controller for drones in non-inertial frames.
- ðŸŒ± I'm working as a RA at FAST Lab, Huzhou Institute of ZJU.
